# Blender-Open-Source-Degree #
An open source library to guide one through becoming an expert at blender. 
This is best followed in order but could be taken in any order or skipped around for subjects you already understand.
You will notice a list of other courses such as maths, and art. These are all optional but can really excel your understanding throughout the field of 3D. I would take one along with the normal courses. If you do this throughout you should finish all subjects around the same time coming together in a [logical way](https://media.giphy.com/media/0NwSQpGY6ipgOSt8LL/giphy.gif "logical way"). Last thing to remember is that the Blender section of this all is a new field. There are no big colleges putting out resources for this stuff so its all youtube and other video sites so there will be a very large number of videos in each section. Because of this there will be a playlist for each section so you can keep track easier what you have already gone through.

## Main Courses ##
These courses could be the only thing you take and you will have a very strong grasp on blender and its possibilities. It will take you through the steps of understanding and creating several different types of scenes and objects. You will make many renders and be very experienced by the end. BUT,   I highly suggest continuing down below the "Further Education" because that is where you will really start to understand why Blender is such an incredibly strong piece of software.

+ Retopology [WIP]
```
<details>
           <summary>What you will learn.</summary>
           <p>This was originally in "Further Education" however I think with the way the world is headed towards more game engines and AR/VR this course is a must. Retopology is the act of creating low poly versions of your high quality meshes. The reasoning for this is to be able to bake the detail from the high poly version into a texture that you can use on the low poly in order to have fast scenes with high detail. You will learn how to do this fully in Blender and not rely on a 3rd part sofware like [Substance Painter](https://i.redd.it/ddivkxo86da61.jpg "Substance Painter")..</p>

<details>
           <summary>What you will learn.</summary>
           <p>Everything that has ever caught your eye as being a fake 3D object in a picture has been most likely due to bad lighting. Lighting can bring an object into the real world. We will find out how this is possible by simulating light bounces to accurately light our scene.</p>

## Further Education ##
These do not have to be taken in order these are more of an "elective" group. Pick and choose the ones that interest you most, however, I promise you they all offer their own way of furthering your knowledge in Blender and its capabilities.

Here we will explore concepts of cinema in Blender with camera plugins and realistic camera movements/interactions.</p>

           <p>I originally had this as a main course however I realize there are a large portion of people who will never touch the rigging and animation side of 3D. Because of this I have included it here however if you ever plan on taking 3D serious this is a must take. The art of rigging and the art of animation are hugely respected and this course only scratches the surface so please keep practicing.</p>

           <p>This is a growing list of courses that can offer an insight on how Blender is quicly coming to compete with apps like Houdini at procedural modeling and tool creation. Yes I know "Blender will never be Houdini" but if we have that mindset it won't. You should want to see this incredible free tool compete with the big guys[which it already does in so many fields].</p>

## How The World Works ##
Pretentious title but I didn't want to call it maths and art and scare you. At the end of the day the reason for this is to further you understanding of what you can do with math and art concepts in blender but at the same time maths and art do connect to nature and that shows up a lot in 3D. This is a hard set of classes and don't blame anyone who ignores this section but trust me if 3D interests you these concepts will really excel your learning.
